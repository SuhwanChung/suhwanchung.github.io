Thanks for stopping by ! I’m Suhwan—glad you’re here!

I’m passionate about creating **machine learning models and integrating them into business processes to drive impact**. Over my career, I’ve developed data-driven solutions that transformed both the bottom line and top line growth.

For the bottom line, during COVID-19, I led a 3-year project in medical device manufacturer that **transformed supply chain demand forecasting**. By leveraging machine learning and external demand-sensing signals, we improved accuracy by 10-15% across 1,200 SKUs, automated forecasting workflows, and retired traditional manual planning - proud to have contributed to the delivery of essential medical products to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.

On the top line, I designed **portfolio growth evaluation models** for medical technology products, mapping market share against theoretical potential. The tools developed through the projects (*e.g., data acquisition tool, modeling, and BI*) were integrated into annual marketing plans, they replaced guesswork by supporting data-driven market landscape.

Now, in the banking sector, I focus on transaction monitoring models for anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. I developed a programmatic, multi-step model calibration framework to improve risk coverage and reduced false positives by 5%.

While working full-time throughout my professional career, I pursued a Master of Science and PhD studies in computer science, focusing on time series modeling and its applications to forecasting use cases.

Outside of work, my family—my amazing wife and two wonderful kids—keeps me grounded and motivated here in Singapore. ✨
