Many asset classes have appreciated dramatically during the low interest rate environment of the last few years, especially equities. The S&P 500 forward P/E multiple has expanded by 25% compared with the summer of 2019.

Many retail investors are questioning whether they can invest in equity market in 2022 after watching nearly uninterrupted upward trajectory to reach its all-time high since March 2020. In this post, we will review insights and the prospects of 2022/23 equity market outlook. All the data, figures, and information in this post is based on Goldman Sachs reports published in 16 November 2021, which you can download the series below in this post.

### Goldman Sachs’s position for 2022/23 US Equity Market
Goldman Sachs expects “fatter & flatter” equity return during 2022 than in 2021 and forecasts the S&P500 index will climb by 9% to 5100 at year-end 2022.

We have started the market expansion with high valuations, record profits/margins and record low interest rates. Through the balance of the cycle, Goldman Sachs expects lower return at 9% in 2022 than in 2021, “Fatter & Flatter” market with lower aggregate returns within a wider range.

The forecast is based on the market squeezing higher supported by negative real interest rates and continued aggregate profit growth of S&P 500. The investment firm expects the Earnings Per Share (EPS) of S&P 500 will grow by 8% and 4% in 2022/23 respectively.

Although all financial assets currently have high valuations relative to history and the Fed will likely begin hiking in July 2022 causing to rise 10-year Treasury yields to 2% by the end of 2022, the impact will be offset by a declining equity risk premium as the policy uncertainty declines and consumer confidence rises and the stock market remains attractive. So the corporate and household demand will help support high valuation.

### Here’s more details of Goldman Sach’s bull market position:
First, historically, declining interests rates have always accompanied high valuation and corporate margins for the last 20 years historically. The Fed responded to the pandemic by flooding market with liquidity and pushing the funds rate to zero. The rising trajectory will continue in 2022/23.

Second, from policy standpoint, the Fed will likely begin to hike rates in July 2022, but the real rates will still remain negative as corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices due to unchanged corporate tax rates, leading to attract more investors to equity market

Third, from profit/margin standpoint, managements have responded to the supply chain disruptions and cost problems by using price increases, cost controls, and technology to preserve margins, and many of the headwinds will ease in 2022. But it expects a tight labor market will persists and drive wage inflation and advises to avoid high labor cost firms.

Fourth, from valuation and money flow standpoints, households/corporates will continue to shift cash . Goldman Sachs predicts households and corporations will be the key sources of demand for equities in 2022. Equity allocation typically increase when consumer confidence increases, policy uncertainty declines, and growth expectations rise suggesting that a strong 2022 macro environment could further support rising allocations.

Although the positive prospects on the equity market outlook in 2022/23, the institution advises retail investors to expect modest below-average returns next year at around 10% which is far below than the stellar 26% return in 2021.

### “Investors should expect below-average return in 2022/23”
Goldman Sachs forecasts 10% YTD return in 2022. Counter to the intuition of many investors, the stellar 26% YTD return during pandemic is not a good reason to expect the weak return in 2022/23. Let’s take a look at how the 10% YTD yield is calculated.

1. From price standpoint, S&P500 historically generated an average 12-month return of 8% when interest rates are rising: Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields are key variables in 2022. The S&P 500 historically generated an average 12-month return of 8% in environments of rising interests rates. Also the index has generated average 12-month return of 10% since 1900.

2. From Sales/Earnings standpoint, aggregate sales for S&P 500 index will rise by 9% in 2022: Goldman Sachs forecasts an aggregate sales for S&P 500 index will rise by 9% in 2022 and 5% in 2023 due to continued gains. Congress will enact tax reform legislation in 22′ but the effective corporate tax rate will occur in 23′. If the existing tax law is unchanged it would add to growth for EPS by 4% and 6% in 2022 and 2023.

Also, interests rates which rise gradually will offset an Equity Risk Premium (ERP) according to the investment firm. Economists from Goldman Sachs expect the nominal 10-year US Treasury yield will rise 2% by end of 2022 driven primarily by increasing real rates. If this forecast is realized, both nominal and real interest rates would still remain extremely low by historical standards and continue to support the relative attractiveness of equities.

### “However Worse-than-expected inflation pressures can reduce the S&P500 to 3500”

{% include aligner.html images="posts/invest-market22/S4.png" caption="S&P 500 year-end 2022 price projection by Goldman Sachs" %}

The report insists, worse-than-expected inflation pressures can weigh on consumer demand and may damage profit margins. In this scenario, Goldman Sachs expect zero earnings growth in 2022 alongside a large decline in valuations.

Another risk is market concentration in FAAMG companies (FB, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) which account for 23% of S&P 500 market cap and 17% of total earnings. Shifting tax and regulatory policy are risk factors borne by investors in the current equity market structure. The Biden administration directed officials to be more stringent in their enforcement of antitrust regulations. The FTC’s new stance appears to have already disrupted FAAMG’s acquisitions of competitors, which may hinder the group’s future growth prospects. Although the tighter antitrust regulation appears to have slowed acquisition activity, it is difficult to estimate the contribution these acquisitions have played in FAAMG’s revenue growth. In other words, FAAMG could find lucrative growth investment opportunities.


### So which stock should we invest in?
The report suggests three investment strategies and sector recommendations inline with the 2022 forecasts.

> “Buy virus- and inflation-exposed Stocks”

The report says in the short term strong economic growth and peaking inflation rates should support the outperformance of cyclical equities including “re-opening” stocks and those exposed to recent input cost headwinds. Declining virus and inflation headwinds combined are factors should provide near-term boosts to revenues and margins for businesses exposed to these challenges. Baskets of virus-exposed stocks have outperformed in recent months but still trade below levels reached earlier this year.

Financials is expected to benefit from strong US and global economy in early 2022 and is a rare sector that typically outperforms in environments when real rates drive nominal rates higher.

> “Avoid high labor cost stocks”

Labor market tightness will likely remain a challenge during the next few years. In contrast with stocks exposed to supply chain challenges, stocks vulnerable to the wage cost will remain under pressure, and Goldman Sachs advise to avoid companies with high labor cost exposure.

> “Buy high growth, high margin stocks vs. high growth, unprofitable stocks”

The report recommends to own highly profitable long duration growth stocks and avoid fast-growing firms valued entirely on long-term growth expectations which will be more vulnerable to the risk of rising interest rates or disappointing revenues. It advise to move Tech stocks to overweight on expectations of secular growth, high margins, and historical average valuation. Goldman Sachs maintained a long-term overweight position in IT/Tech sector since December 2016 and continue to find its elevated profit margins and growth.

Although the upcoming rate hikes by the Fed will not derail the bull market, but the historical experience during the Fed tightening period suggests further valuation expansion is unlikely. Stocks with valuations entirely dependent on future growth are vulnerable to a dramatic drop in price if rates rise sharply or revenue growth expectations are reduced. In contrast, growth stocks with elevated profitability have comparatively shorter durations, and therefore less vulnerability to rising interest rates.

As shown in the Figure above (top right) stocks with high growth rates but low profitability (margins) and extremely profitable growth stocks (bottom right) trade at similar valuations, because current interest rates are so low. The valuations of profitable growth stocks should be less vulnerable to rising rates than those of their low-margin peers.
