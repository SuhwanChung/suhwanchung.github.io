I’ve experienced years of championing commercial (sales & marketing) transformation initiatives through companies from Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and Becton Dickinson. However, many organizations struggled with lackluster performance. Big investments in training (e.g., Solution Sellings) and sales technology (e.g., Salesforce.com) have delivered negligible returns. Collaborative analytics (integrated analytics methodology), designed to align marketing strategies with sales execution, helps businesses adopt best practices and significantly improve growth.

### Diagnosis: Misalignment between strategy and execution
It is no surprise that change at this scale is inherently difficult. At General Electric, the company invested in commercial excellence by hiring a group of commercial excellence specialists across Asia. However, **this initiative encountered significant challenges due to siloed sales and marketing strategies** that operated without shared targeting across key strategic areas. This lack of alignment resulted in misaligned marketing budget spendings and ineffective sales resource allocation.

In my experience with commercial excellence, too many sales and marketing transformations fail even before implementation begins. Sales leaders often **independently build opportunity funnels based on their immediate observations at the front line without stepping back to evaluate whether the plan is achievable**. On the marketing side, significant budgets are allocated to market research. Yet, much of this market research remains one-off exercises, tied to the new product launches or annual marketing plans. In many cases, these insights are not integrated into the company's internal database or operational analytics tools. Instead, they stay siloed, dependent on the knowledge of individual marketers or presentation slides and fail to flow into the models and processes that drive business decisions. This **disconnects between marketing strategy and sales execution leaves transformations** fail even before implementation begins.

### Collaborative Analytics: Putting Analytics at the Core of Transformation
Without **collaborative analytics frameworks**, commercial transformation efforts remain siloed and **create misalignment between marketing budget allocations and sales reps' account visits** logged in *Salesforce.com*. In fact, when I compared marketing spend to actual account visits by Reps, there was rarely any correlation. This is an example of how a lack of integration between sales and marketing strategies can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

It doesn't have to be this way. Through my work with 8 country sales and marketing leaders in Asia at Becton Dickinson, it has become clear that implementing **collaborative analytics—combining market research, opportunity funnel management, and supporting advanced analytics**—can significantly improve the odds of transformation success without big investments. The collaborative analytical approach I led to drive transformation is built around four key elements, which are illustrated in the exhibits below.

#### 1. Comprehensive Data-Mining: Focus on “how”
Most primary and secondary market research is published in isolated formats (e.g., PDF). These formats are not compatible with operational database and analytical tools. **This disconnect highlight the need to develop comprehensive internal data mining capabilities that can transform static market research into integrated, actionable formats**. 

To estimate potential demand, we required detailed data on the number of medical procedures conducted at each hospital, including surgeries, procedure counts, and the number of beds at their accounts. Collecting this data was demanding exercise, so our team developed a user-friendly interface using a Power Apps platform to help sales reps to input data intuitively. Once the raw data was submitted, marketers applied their formulas to calculate market potential for each medical procedure and product category. 

**This effort resulted in a data-backed view of potential growth, segmented by category, geography, and account**. To ensure accuracy, we secured buy-in from country business leaders by emphasizing the value of the exercise and timed the three-week data collection period at the end of the year to support next year’s planning. National marketers and sales leaders reviewed the data for accuracy, with the numbers fully owned by country business leaders, as they were based on input from the Reps on the ground. We also introduced interim reporting to track progress and motivate teams. These quick updates helped ensure accountability and allowed leadership to monitor how market data collection efforts were progressing in real time.

#### 2. Design Bird's-eye View: Product/Account-wise Headroom 
An analytical transformation must go beyond using market data at the initial stage. Stopping at category-level market research often leads to failure, as sales operating models typically is built on territory or account-level planning rather than broad categories. For large global healthcare companies managing 400 to 1,000 accounts nationally (depending on market size) integrating market data into account-level planning is essential for aligning marketing and sales insights. Companies that have invested in CRM systems like *Salesforce.com* can use this foundation to map account addresses through visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, creating account-level views of growth potential and enabling data-driven strategic decisions.

We developed a Tableau dashboard to track headroom from multiple angles - category-wise, state-wise, and account-wise - setting a stage for unified, single source of market intelligence. This tool was as a foundational resource to enable more actionable marketing strategies and sales insights by leveraging market research data mining capabilities.

#### 3. Agile Deployment: Headroom alignment with Opportunity Funnels
The best systems must deliver immediate insights into what’s working and what’s not, flag deviations from expected performance, and recommend opportunities to improve. When we attempted to correlate headroom values to the existing opportunity funnels created by Reps, there wasn’t a straightforward relationship. When a 80% growth potential lies in one of the syringe products at a customer segments, the opportunity funnel created from Salesforce indicated poor growth in the coming year. This shows example of the unmatched market potential and sales executions, and due to the entry of data into the CRM system without careful planning and considerations. 

For the transformation, from the top-down view, we higlighted the importance to realign opportunity funnels and sales leaders needed to follow up on. Because the marketing strategies and narratives for the annual budget spending is completely aligned with the headroom data that we built in the previous stage, it was essential stage to integarte the marketing strategies to the sales executions. 

Our team overlay opportunity funnel value to the headroom to show how much a year head opportunity capture accurately addresses the headroom for growth opportunities. This dashboard helped managers all the way to the C-suite identify biggest growing potential accounts in Japan, see how the marketing strategies are aligned with the sales execution, and where might need their leadership level support or coaching to win the big deal. 

The combination of reporting, enablement, and leadership feedback delivered an enormous impact very quickly: 7 percent uptick in revenues for that quarter since the combined models operationalized. This didn’t require a significant investment, just making the information available at the individual level.

### Wrapping up
"Great business leaders run their operations with the precision of an engineering firm." This quote, from the head of adviser sales at a US financial-services firm, perfectly captures how a strong collaborative analytical system forms the foundation of business transformation—aligning marketing strategies with sales execution. Such a system sets clear direction, establishes metrics, tracks performance, enables ongoing dialogue, incentivizes desired behaviors, and helps managers take continuous action to improve outcomes. 

Building robust data and analytics capabilities enables faster, more actionable decision-making. Collaborative analytics, designed to integrate marketing and sales insights through automated, personalized dashboards, becomes a powerful tool for commercial organizations undergoing transformation. These dashboards help identify gaps between market opportunities and the opportunities that sales teams are actually capturing.

One final note: despite implementing extensive automation in our analytical processes, we maintained regular check-ins with our team. These personal interactions helped us verify that our new analytical models were sustaining the integration between marketing and sales.
