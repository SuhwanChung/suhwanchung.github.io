Thanks for stopping by !

I’m passionate about Data and Advanced Analytics to lead transformation initiatives and drive measurable business improvements. Over my career, I've delivered data-driven solutions that transformed both bottom-line efficiency and top-line growth at large organizations like Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and Becton Dickinson.

During COVID-19, I led a 3-year transformation project at a global medical device manufacturer, where we deployed machine learning to improve demand forecasting accuracy by 10–15% across essential medical products for COVID-19 treatments. This automated manual planning processes and ensured the timely delivery of essential medical products to hospitals—a project I’m truly proud of.

On the top line, I designed commercial excellence solution by leveraging data and analytics to find overlooked growth opportunities. By quantifying market size, company share, and headroom for growth, and integrating these insights into annual marketing plans, we reshaped strategies with data-driven decisions that delivered measurable business outcomes.

While working full-time, I pursued advanced studies, Master of Science and PhD studies in data science. My focus was on pdictive forecasting models for demand forecasting. Outside of work, my family, my wife and two kids, keeps me grounded and motivated here in Singapore. ✨
