This study explores the use of embeddings for analyzing gene expression (GE) and micro-RNA (miRNA) data, focusing on a multi-omics approach. By learning gene, miRNA, and sample embeddings from this dataset, we constructed correlation networks and performed pathway analysis to uncover biological processes and pathways associated with breast cancer.

Our findings showed that these embeddings were effective in identifying significant entities, such as miR-100 and miR-16, which are thought to play crucial roles in breast cancer development. Moreover, the multi-omics embeddings revealed modules corresponding to different functional pathways. Notably, the ‚Äúbrown module‚Äù emerged as a potential contributor to breast cancer.

Further pathway analysis of the entire gene set highlighted numerous enriched pathways related to cell regulation, protein processing, and the immune system, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of breast cancer.
