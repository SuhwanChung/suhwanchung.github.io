Thanks for stopping by ! I’m Suhwan—glad you’re here!

I’m passionate about creating machine learning models and integrating them into business processes to drive impact. Over my career, I’ve developed data-driven solutions that transformed both the bottom line and top line growth.

For the **bottom line**, I led a 3-year project in manufacturing that transformed supply chain demand forecasting. By leveraging machine learning and external demand-sensing signals, we improved accuracy by 10-15% across 1,200 SKUs, automating forecasting workflows and retiring traditional manual planning practices.

On the **top line**, I designed portfolio growth evaluation models for medical technology products, mapping market share against theoretical potential. These insights were integrated into annual marketing plans, it replaced guesswork by supporting data-driven market landscape.

Now, in the banking sector, I focus on transaction monitoring models for anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. I developed a programmatic, three-step model calibration framework to improve risk coverage and reduce false positives by 5% - which balances operational efficiency and maintaining risk coverage.

While working full-time throughout my professional career, I pursued a Master of Science and PhD studies in computer science, focusing on time series modeling and its applications to forecasting use cases.

This blog is where I share projects and ideas — whenever inspiration strikes. Outside of work, my family—my amazing wife and two wonderful kids—keeps me grounded and motivated.
