üè∑Ô∏è DataMeka competition series

Back in 2023, I organized a Machine Learning competition and launched a `machine learning playground` called DataMeka. This initiative was a collaborative effort collaborating with 8 researchers, fellow PhDs students, and professors in Singapore. Our first competition series was predictive modeling Singapore housing price and find factors affecting to the real estate market. 

### Competition Overview: House Hacking
Participants had the choice to compete in one or both of the following categories:
1. **Predictiev Model Building**: Develop a predictive model to forecast private housing prices for the next three months.
2. **Business Problem Solving**: Analyze trends and answer key business questions related to real estate pricing and property valuation.

If you're interested in the specifics of the competition structure, [here's a link](https://github.com/SuhwanChung/DataMeka_Singaporehousingprice/blob/main/README.md) to the competition overview page.

Our competition featured an exceptionally comprehensive real estate dataset. It included individual property details like zoning, type, bedrooms, and floor area. We also provided OpenMap geographical data on proximity to key facilities. Additional data encompassed Singapore's rental index, economic indicators (CPI, interest rates), and vacancy rates for condominiums. I have made the dataset available for you.

### My contributions as a competition organizer
To provide context for this competition, we contributed research in several areas. First, our team offered baseline code to help participants get started quickly. The baseline models include LGBM, Neural Networks, and Linear Regression‚Äîapproaches commonly used in real estate forecasting tasks according to prior literature. Here's a snapshot of the model shared with participants, along with a set of exogenous variables to guide participants' predictive modeling efforts.

```python
class LRArgs:
    modelName = "LR"
    kwargs = {}        

class LGBMArgs:
    modelName = "LGBM"
    kwargs    = {"boosting_type" :'gbdt',
                 "objective"     :'regression',
                 "learning_rate" : 0.1}
class NNArgs:
    modelName = "NN"
    kwargs = {"hidden_layer_sizes" : (512,100),
              "learning_rate_init" : 0.001,
              "max_iter"           : 500}

class Args :
    inputVars = {"price"                 : float, # to predict    
                 "area"                  : float,
                 "floorRange"            : str,
                 "propertyType"          : str,
                 "district"              : str,
                 "typeOfArea"            : str,
                 "tenure"                : float,
                 "marketSegment"         : str,
                 "lat"                   : float,
                 "lng"                   : float,
                 "num_schools_1km"       : float,
                 "num_supermarkets_500m" : float,
                 "num_mrt_stations_500m" : float,
                 "CPI"                   : float,
                 "InterestRate"          : float,
                 "RentIndex"             : float,
                 "Available"             : float,
                 "Vacant"                : float,                
                 "train"                 : float}

    modelArgs = {"LR"   : LRArgs,
                 "LGBM" : LGBMArgs,
                 "NN"   : NNArgs}["LGBM"] # default is LGBM

#### EDA
Another contribution we made for participants was helping to unravel the relationships within the market segments, as a step for feature engineering. The Singapore real estate market can be segmented into three main categories:

1. **Core Central Region (CCR)**: Includes the Downtown Core and Sentosa areas.
2. **Rest of the Central Region (RCR)**: Covers central areas not part of the CCR.
3. **Outside Central Region (OCR)**: Encompasses all other areas in Singapore.

Additionally, `housing types` in Singapore are categorized into four groups:
1. **Public**: HDB flats
2. **Public-Private Hybrid**: Executive Condominiums (ECs)
3. **Private**: Condominiums, apartments, terraced houses, semi-detached homes, cluster townhouses, shophouses, etc.
4. **Landed House**

To support participants, we provided a correlation plot to highlight moderate relationships between price, area, and market segments. The heatmap generated from this correlation matrix helped reveal these connections visually.

Running an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential step for building predictive models. For instance, the price trends we analyzed by district showed a clear upward trend in Rest of the Central Region (RCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR) districts due to the rising demand. By contrast, price fluctuations in Core Central Region (CCR) were generally more stable.

#### Feature Engineering: find informative predictors
Further, analyzing property prices per square foot (PSF) revealed that while prices were increasing across all regions, the PSF metric gave a further view of how prices were changing relative to property size. This PSF analysis allowed for more accurate comparisons between properties of different sizes.

Interestingly, despite a common preference for high-floor units, our findings indicated no significant differences in price trends between high and low floors.

In addition to the EDA, we provided visualizations to give participants a geographical view of housing prices across Singapore. One key visualization was a heatmap showing the `average price per area`, which was overlaid on a map of Singapore.

The heatmap is constructed using `folium` and `matplotlib` which combines datasets on property attributes and geographical coordinates to present a dynamic visual representation of price distributions.

#### Feature Engineering: government policy and cooling measures
Government policies, particularly cooling measures, significantly impact Singapore's property market. Participants had to incorporate these policies to enhance their model accuracy, going beyond just price trends and geographical factors.

Here‚Äôs how policies come into play: The timing of cooling measures, shifts in tax policies like *Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD)*, and changes to *loan ratios (LTV, TDSR)* can all create market fluctuations. Additionally, government land sales programs influence supply dynamics and, in turn, property prices.

{% include aligner.html images="portfolio/Housing/S8.png"%}

However, predicting when the government will introduce new cooling measures remains challenging. These decisions are often driven by a mix of economic conditions, market sentiment, and external factors like global economy. Thus, it‚Äôs important to track price trends closely. If prices rise too quickly, cooling measures might be introduced, causing a temporary dip in prices. Conversely, if prices are stable or declining, policies might be enacted to boost demand.

### Collective Efforts from Participants
890 participants enrolled in this competition, and we received 350 submissions. The first-place winner's solution implemented a stacking ensemble using 9 machine learning models, including LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost models, each customized with different sets of endogenous/exogenous features and hyper-parameters. 

I‚Äôm happy to share some standout submissions.

- 2nd place winner solutionParticipant B‚Äôs Approach: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/SuhwanChung/DataMeka_Singaporehousingprice/blob/main/submission/2nd%20place%20winner%20-%20Christeigen%20Theodore%20Suhalim.ipynb)


By incorporating the winning models into our geographic visualizations, we were able to display predictive prices at the individual property level across the map of Singapore.
